# opx User Guide

`opx` downloads near-term option chains, enriches them with pricing and screening metrics, writes a timestamped CSV, and serves a local browser UI for inspection.

## Overview

- Fetches call and put chains for configured tickers
- Filters out zero-bid and wide-spread contracts before export
- Limits strikes to a configurable band around spot
- Computes Greeks, expected move, ROM-style metrics, and volatility context
- Writes a timestamped CSV plus an append-only run log
- Includes a local browser for exploring the output interactively

The output is designed to be data-focused rather than decision-focused. It does not decide whether to close, roll, or open positions. Instead, it produces a richer dataset that can support those decisions elsewhere.

Warning: Yahoo Finance quote timestamps can lag, and the collected option or underlying data may be stale. Sparse or empty option-chain results are especially common near the regular market open because Yahoo data is delayed and cached, option markets may not have fully formed yet, the `yfinance` API is scraping-based and can be unreliable, and immediate post-open liquidity is often thin. Always check the freshness fields in the CSV or browser before relying on the output for trading decisions.

Warning: Massive options support for this project requires a Massive account with an options plan that exposes the option snapshot data, a usable underlying price, and quote access when you expect `bid` and `ask` to be populated. `Options Basic` does not expose the required access, `Options Starter` is the entry point for delayed options data, and lower tiers may still leave this app with trades but no quote fields. In practice, `bid` and `ask` access may require Massive's highest-cost quote-enabled options plan. Confirm your plan includes the quote and underlying-price coverage you expect before treating the output as current market data.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install
python fetcher.py
python viewer.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

## Running

Fetch data from the repository root:

```bash
python fetcher.py
```

Run the local viewer:

```bash
python viewer.py
```

The viewer includes:

- a sortable table for the exported CSV
- hover descriptions on column headers pulled from this guide
- a file selector for available CSV exports
- a `Reference` tab that shows the CSV field documentation
- a `Summary` tab for per-ticker snapshot metrics and opportunity highlights
- a dark/light mode toggle
- header filters, including numeric min/max filtering for numeric columns
- dataset-level header cards for shared run metrics such as premium reference method

## Output

Each run writes a CSV file to the `outputs/` directory using a timestamped filename:

```text
outputs/options_engine_output_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
```

Operational details that are not row-specific are written to:

```text
logs/opx_runs.log
```

The run log records:

- per-expiration raw row counts returned by the active provider before app-side filtering
- per-ticker raw contract totals and kept-row totals
- provider-library error messages routed into the same log file when available
- final CSV row count and file size after export

If `debug_dump_provider_payload = true`, raw provider payload JSON files are also written under `debug_dump_dir`. Massive dumps are written per API response page with filenames such as `massive_TSLA_snapshot_chain_page_001_...json`, while yfinance dumps use labels such as `yfinance_TSLA_option_chain_2026-04-17_...json`.

## Configuration

Runtime configuration lives in `~/.config/opx/config.toml`. If the file is absent, the app falls back to built-in defaults and uses `yfinance` as the active provider.

If individual config values are missing, malformed, or out of range, the loader applies built-in defaults for those fields and the fetcher prints the resolved values plus any fallback warnings at startup.

Example config:

```toml
[settings]
tickers = ["TSLA", "NVDA", "UBER", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "ORCL", "PLTR"]
data_provider = "yfinance"
min_bid = 0.50
min_open_interest = 100
min_volume = 10
max_spread_pct_of_mid = 0.25
max_strike_distance_pct = 0.30
risk_free_rate = 0.045
hv_lookback_days = 30
trading_days_per_year = 252
stale_quote_seconds = 900
enable_post_download_filters = true
debug_dump_provider_payload = false
debug_dump_dir = "debug"
max_expiration_weeks = 26

[providers.massive]
api_key = "replace-me"
snapshot_page_limit = 250
request_interval_seconds = 12.0
```

Current defaults:

- `TICKERS = ["TSLA", "NVDA", "UBER", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "ORCL", "PLTR"]`: list of underlyings to fetch.
- `MIN_BID = 0.50`: excludes very low-premium contracts, in addition to the hard `bid == 0` filter.
- `MIN_OPEN_INTEREST = 100`: baseline open-interest threshold used by the screening metrics.
- `MIN_VOLUME = 10`: baseline daily volume threshold used by the screening metrics.
- `MAX_SPREAD_PCT_OF_MID = 0.25`: excludes contracts with spreads wider than 25% of midpoint.
- `MAX_STRIKE_DISTANCE_PCT = 0.30`: keeps only strikes within +/-30% of the latest underlying price.
- `RISK_FREE_RATE = 0.045`: risk-free rate used in Black-Scholes calculations.
- `HV_LOOKBACK_DAYS = 30`: lookback window for historical volatility.
- `TRADING_DAYS_PER_YEAR = 252`: annualization factor for volatility.
- `STALE_QUOTE_SECONDS = 900`: staleness threshold for option and underlying quotes.
- `ENABLE_POST_DOWNLOAD_FILTERS = true`: applies the zero-bid, strike-band, and wide-spread row filters after download. Set it to `false` when you want the raw downloaded rows to remain in the exported dataset while still computing metrics and quality flags.
- `DEBUG_DUMP_PROVIDER_PAYLOAD = false`: when `true`, dump raw provider payloads to JSON before normalization so missing fields can be inspected directly.
- `DEBUG_DUMP_DIR = "debug"`: directory used for raw provider payload dumps. Dump filenames are prefixed with the provider name.
- `MAX_EXPIRATION_WEEKS = 26`: caps expirations to roughly the next six months by default. Set it to any positive week count you want, or `0` to disable the expiration cap entirely.
- `data_provider = "yfinance"`: provider implementation used by the fetch pipeline.
- `providers.massive.snapshot_page_limit = 250`: per-request Massive snapshot page size used for the option-chain endpoint. Values above `250` are clamped because the Massive snapshot endpoint rejects larger limits.
- `providers.massive.request_interval_seconds = 12.0`: minimum delay between Massive HTTP requests. This default is conservative for delayed-plan usage.
- `SCRIPT_VERSION = "2026-03-23.3"`: run-version string written to the append-only log.

In practice:

- Change `tickers` when you want a different watchlist.
- Tighten or loosen the threshold values when you want a narrower or broader tradability filter.
- Set `enable_post_download_filters = false` when you want to keep rows that would normally be removed by the shared post-download filters.
- Turn on `debug_dump_provider_payload = true` when you need to inspect the raw provider payload and confirm whether fields such as `last_quote`, `underlying_asset`, or Yahoo chain columns were present before normalization.
- Change `max_expiration_weeks` when you want a shorter or longer expiration window, or set it to `0` to disable the max-expiration cutoff.
- Change the rate, lookback, trading-day, or staleness settings only if you want different modeling or freshness assumptions.
- Switch `data_provider` when you want to use a different market-data implementation.
- Add `[providers.massive].api_key` only when you select `massive`.
- Raise or lower `snapshot_page_limit` and `request_interval_seconds` to match your Massive plan and tolerance for throttling.

Startup output:

- The fetcher prints the config path it read, whether the file exists, and the full set of resolved runtime values it will apply.
- Secret values are redacted in that output. For example, the Massive API key is shown as `set` or `not set`, never in plaintext.
- When a config value is invalid and a code default is used instead, the fetcher prints a `Config fallbacks:` block so the override is visible.
- During each ticker fetch, the fetcher prints provider progress, expiration counts, raw provider row counts, normalized-versus-kept row counts, and final kept rows so empty runs can be traced to a specific stage.
- `python fetcher.py` exits with status `0` after a successful CSV write, `1` when the run finishes with `No data fetched.`, and `130` when interrupted with `Ctrl+C`.
