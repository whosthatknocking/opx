# opx

`opx` is a Python tool for downloading near-term option chains from Yahoo Finance, enriching them with pricing and screening metrics, and exporting the result to a timestamped CSV. It also includes a local browser UI for inspecting the generated dataset in a sortable table.

## At a Glance

- Fetches call and put chains for configured tickers
- Filters out zero-bid and wide-spread contracts before export
- Limits strikes to a configurable band around spot
- Computes Greeks, expected move, ROM-style metrics, and volatility context
- Writes a timestamped CSV plus an append-only run log
- Includes a local browser for exploring the output interactively

## What It Does

The script fetches near-term option chains for a configured list of tickers, normalizes the raw vendor data, excludes contracts with a zero bid, excludes contracts whose bid-ask spread is 25% or more of midpoint, limits contracts to strikes within +/-30% of the latest underlying price, calculates quality and pricing metrics, computes Black-Scholes Greeks, and writes a CSV file that another tool can consume.

The output is designed to be data-focused rather than decision-focused. It does not decide whether to close, roll, or open positions. Instead, it produces a richer dataset that can support those decisions elsewhere.

Warning: Yahoo Finance quote timestamps can lag, and the collected option, underlying, or VIX data may be stale. Sparse or empty option-chain results are especially common near the regular market open because Yahoo data is delayed and cached, option markets may not have fully formed yet, the `yfinance` API is scraping-based and can be unreliable, and immediate post-open liquidity is often thin. Always check the freshness fields in the CSV or browser before relying on the output for trading decisions.

Warning: Massive options support for this project requires a Massive account with an options plan that exposes both the option snapshot data and a usable underlying price for the fetch path. `Options Basic` does not expose the required access, and while `Options Starter` is the entry point for delayed options data, this app's underlying-price-dependent calculations and strike filtering may be incomplete unless you have `Options Developer` or higher. Confirm your plan includes the underlying-price coverage you expect before treating the output as current market data.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install
python fetcher.py
python viewer.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

## What You Get

- Fetches call and put chains for configured tickers
- Limits expirations to a rolling four-month window
- Excludes contracts with a zero bid
- Excludes contracts with `bid_ask_spread_pct_of_mid >= 0.25`
- Limits strikes to a +/-30% band around the latest underlying price
- Normalizes vendor fields into a stable CSV schema
- Adds quote quality, freshness, liquidity, and pricing metrics
- Adds underlying volatility context with `VIX` and trailing historical volatility
- Adds expiration-level expected move estimates
- Adds roll-yield metrics across expirations at the same strike
- Adds return-on-margin metrics using a transparent margin proxy
- Computes Black-Scholes `delta`, true ITM probability, `gamma`, `vega`, and `theta`
- Exports a timestamped CSV file for each run

## Provider Contract

The runtime uses exactly one active provider per run. The selected provider is recorded in `data_source`, and shared code paths keep the exported CSV pinned to the canonical column set documented in this README.

Provider rules:

- provider-native values should populate canonical columns when the semantics match
- derived app values should be used only when the provider does not supply the canonical field or cannot be mapped safely
- provider-specific scratch or debug fields should not expand the CSV schema implicitly
- mixed-provider rows should not appear in the same output file

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Internet access for Yahoo Finance data
- Python dependencies installed from `requirements.txt`

Key dependencies:

- `yfinance` for the baseline Yahoo Finance provider
- `massive` for the official Massive / Polygon client library
- `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scipy` for normalization and analytics
- `pytest` for the automated test suite
- `playwright` for browser-driven screenshot and UI checks

## How To Run

Run the project from the repository root:

```bash
python fetcher.py
```

## CSV Browser

Run the local viewer from the repository root:

```bash
python viewer.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

![opx viewer](docs/images/viewer-option-chain.png)

The viewer includes:

- a sortable table for the exported CSV
- hover descriptions on column headers pulled from this README
- a file selector for available CSV exports
- a `Readme` tab that shows the CSV field documentation
- a `Summary` tab for per-ticker snapshot metrics and opportunity highlights
- a dark/light mode toggle
- header filters, including numeric min/max filtering for numeric columns
- dataset-level header cards for shared run metrics such as VIX and premium reference method

## Output

Each run writes a CSV file to the `outputs/` directory using a timestamped filename:

```text
outputs/options_engine_output_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
```

Operational details that are not row-specific are written to:

```text
logs/opx_runs.log
```

The run log also records:

- per-expiration raw row counts returned by the active provider before app-side filtering
- per-ticker raw contract totals and kept-row totals
- provider-library error messages routed into the same log file when available
- final CSV row count and file size after export

These log entries are useful when a run returns fewer rows than expected, especially near the regular market open when the active provider may still be delayed, cached, thinly traded, or incomplete. In the current baseline, this is most common with `yfinance`.

## CSV Field Reference

Schema note: the export is pinned to the canonical column set documented here. Provider-specific scratch fields or debug fields should not expand the CSV schema unless the spec is updated deliberately.

The exported CSV contains both provider-supplied and app-derived fields. Some values may be blank when the active provider does not expose the required source data or when a calculation is not valid for that row.

### Contract and Expiration Fields

- `underlying_symbol`: Stock ticker for the option contract. Use it to group rows by underlying.
- `contract_symbol`: Vendor contract identifier. Use it as the unique option contract key.
- `option_type`: `call` or `put`. Use it to separate upside and downside contracts.
- `expiration_date`: Contract expiration date. Use it to sort the chain by maturity.
- `days_to_expiration`: Calendar days until expiration. Use it for short-dated screening and decay analysis. Lower means faster decay and more event risk.
- `time_to_expiration_years`: `days_to_expiration` expressed in years. Use it as the time input for Black-Scholes calculations.
- `strike`: Strike price of the contract. Use it to measure moneyness and break-even.
- `contract_size`: Contract multiplier from the vendor. Yahoo often reports `REGULAR`, while Massive maps the numeric `shares_per_contract` value from the snapshot payload. Use it to confirm contract sizing conventions.

### Underlying Snapshot Fields

- `underlying_price`: Current underlying stock price used in calculations. Use it as the reference price for moneyness and Greeks.
- `underlying_market_state`: Market session state from Yahoo Finance. Use it to judge whether prices are regular-session or extended-hours.
- `underlying_day_change_pct`: Underlying percentage move versus previous close. Use it to add context to the option chain. Large absolute moves mean the underlying is already having an outsized session.
- `historical_volatility`: Annualized realized volatility computed from the underlying's trailing 30 daily log returns. Use it to compare recent realized movement against option-implied pricing. Lower is calmer; higher means the stock has been moving more.
- `vix_level`: Latest CBOE Volatility Index level fetched for the run. Use it as a market-wide volatility regime reference.
- `vix_quote_time`: Timestamp of the VIX snapshot. Use it to judge whether the volatility regime reference is fresh.
- `underlying_price_time`: Timestamp of the underlying quote snapshot. Use it to compare timing with the option quote.
- `underlying_price_age_seconds`: Age of the underlying quote at fetch time. Use it to detect stale stock prices. Lower is better; high values mean the stock snapshot may be stale.
- `is_stale_underlying_price`: Flag showing whether the underlying quote is older than the configured staleness threshold. Use it to down-rank stale rows.

### Raw Option Quote Fields

- `bid`: Current best bid. Use it as the conservative executable premium estimate for selling. Higher means more immediate sell-side premium, all else equal.
- `ask`: Current best ask. Use it as the conservative executable premium estimate for buying.
- `last_trade_price`: Last reported trade price. Use it as a fallback reference when bid and ask are weak or missing.
- `volume`: Current session option volume. Use it as a liquidity signal. Higher usually means better trading activity and easier fills.
- `open_interest`: Open contracts outstanding. Use it to judge market participation and contract depth. Higher usually means deeper, more established trading interest.
- `implied_volatility`: Vendor-supplied implied volatility. Use it as the volatility input for Greeks and relative richness checks. Higher means richer option pricing, but usually also more underlying uncertainty.
- `change`: Absolute price change reported by the vendor. Use it to understand the contract's move during the session.
- `percent_change`: Percentage price change reported by the vendor. Use it for relative move comparisons.
- `option_quote_time`: Timestamp of the option quote or last trade update. Use it to measure quote freshness.
- `is_in_the_money`: In-the-money classification from the provider when available, or derived from spot versus strike when the provider snapshot omits a direct flag. Use it as a quick classification check against derived moneyness fields.

### Quote Quality and Liquidity Fields

- `mark_price_mid`: Midpoint of bid and ask when the quote is valid. Use it as the default fair reference premium.
- `premium_reference_price`: Preferred premium used by derived calculations. It falls back from mid to bid to last trade price.
- `premium_reference_method`: Which source supplied `premium_reference_price`. Use it to judge how reliable premium-based metrics are.
- `bid_ask_spread`: Absolute spread between ask and bid. Use it to measure trading friction. Lower is better.
- `bid_ask_spread_pct_of_mid`: Spread divided by midpoint. Use it to compare spread quality across cheap and expensive contracts. Lower is better; the fetcher currently keeps only rows below `0.25`.
- `spread_to_strike_pct`: Spread divided by strike. Use it to normalize friction relative to contract notional level.
- `spread_to_bid_pct`: Spread divided by bid. Use it to see how expensive the spread is relative to collectible premium. Lower is better.
- `oi_to_volume_ratio`: Open interest divided by volume. Use it to distinguish established positions from fresh trading activity. Very high values can mean established positions but muted current trading.

### Moneyness and Value Fields

- `strike_minus_spot`: Strike minus underlying price. Use it to see whether the strike sits above or below spot.
- `strike_vs_spot_pct`: `strike_minus_spot` as a percentage of spot. Use it for normalized moneyness comparisons.
- `strike_distance_pct`: Absolute distance between strike and spot as a percentage. Use it to find near-the-money contracts. Lower means closer to at-the-money; higher means farther OTM or ITM.
- `itm_amount`: In-the-money amount in dollars. Use it to separate intrinsic value from time value.
- `otm_pct`: Out-of-the-money distance as a percentage of spot. Use it to find target cushion on short options. Higher means more cushion, but usually less premium.
- `intrinsic_value`: Immediate exercise value. Use it as the core in-the-money value component.
- `extrinsic_value_bid`: Time value based on bid price. Use it to estimate conservative sell-side extrinsic premium.
- `extrinsic_value_mid`: Time value based on midpoint. Use it as the main extrinsic premium measure.
- `extrinsic_value_ask`: Time value based on ask price. Use it to estimate buy-side time premium.
- `extrinsic_pct_mid`: Extrinsic value as a share of midpoint price. Use it to compare how much of the option price is time value. Higher means more of the price is time value rather than intrinsic value.
- `has_negative_extrinsic_mid`: Flag showing midpoint is below intrinsic value. Use it to detect bad quotes or pricing anomalies.

### Premium and Return-Oriented Fields

- `premium_to_strike`: Reference premium divided by strike. Use it as a simple premium yield measure.
- `premium_to_strike_bid`: Bid divided by strike. Use it for a more conservative premium yield estimate.
- `premium_to_strike_annualized`: `premium_to_strike` annualized by time to expiration. Use it to compare contracts with different expiries. Higher can be attractive, but very high values often come with more risk or weaker liquidity.
- `premium_per_day`: Reference premium earned per day until expiration. Use it to compare short-dated income efficiency. Higher means more daily premium, but often with more event and assignment risk.
- `estimated_margin_requirement`: Reg-T style per-share margin proxy for a short option, using `premium + max(20% of spot - OTM amount, 10% floor)`. Use it as the denominator for ROM-style comparisons. Lower means less capital tied up, but not necessarily less real risk.
- `return_on_margin`: `premium_reference_price / estimated_margin_requirement`. Use it to compare premium collected relative to estimated capital at risk. Higher is usually better if quote quality and downside risk are still acceptable.
- `return_on_margin_annualized`: `return_on_margin` annualized by time to expiration. Use it to compare ROM across expirations. Higher is stronger on paper, but extreme values deserve extra caution.
- `break_even_if_short`: Price where a short option position breaks even at expiration. Use it to evaluate downside or upside buffer.
- `expected_move`: One-standard-deviation expected dollar move for that expiration, computed as `spot * ATM_IV * sqrt(time)`. Use it as the core expected-move estimate for the expiry.
- `expected_move_pct`: `expected_move` as a percentage of spot. Use it to compare expected move across underlyings. Lower means a calmer implied move; higher means the market expects more movement.
- `expected_move_lower_bound`: Spot minus `expected_move`. Use it as the lower expected-move boundary into expiration.
- `expected_move_upper_bound`: Spot plus `expected_move`. Use it as the upper expected-move boundary into expiration.

### Greek Fields

- `delta`: Black-Scholes delta. Use it as an estimate of directional sensitivity and a rough probability proxy.
- `delta_abs`: Absolute value of delta. Use it when you only care about magnitude, not call-versus-put sign. Lower usually means farther OTM; higher means closer to or deeper ITM.
- `delta_itm_proxy`: Delta normalized so higher values mean more in-the-money for both calls and puts. Use it for side-agnostic moneyness ranking.
- `probability_itm`: Black-Scholes probability of finishing in the money, derived from `d2` rather than delta. Use it when you want the model-based ITM probability instead of the delta approximation. Lower generally means less assignment/exercise risk for short premium trades.
- `gamma`: Black-Scholes gamma. Use it to measure how quickly delta changes as the stock moves. Higher means position risk can change faster as spot moves.
- `vega`: Black-Scholes vega. Use it to measure sensitivity to implied volatility changes. Higher means the option is more sensitive to vol expansion or crush.
- `vega_per_day`: Vega divided by days to expiration. Use it to compare vol sensitivity across expiries on a per-day basis.
- `theta`: Black-Scholes daily theta. Use it to estimate daily time decay.
- `theta_to_premium_ratio`: Absolute theta divided by premium. Use it to compare time decay efficiency relative to premium collected or paid. Higher means faster daily decay relative to the option price.

### Validation, Freshness, and Screening Fields

- `has_valid_underlying`: True when the underlying price is positive. Use it to reject rows with unusable stock data.
- `has_valid_strike`: True when strike is positive. Use it to reject malformed contracts.
- `has_valid_quote`: True when bid and ask exist, are non-negative, and bid is not above ask. Use it to filter bad quotes.
- `has_valid_iv`: True when implied volatility is positive. Use it to identify rows suitable for Greek calculations.
- `has_valid_greeks`: True when the inputs required for Black-Scholes are valid. Use it to filter out rows with unreliable Greeks.
- `bid_le_ask`: True when bid is less than or equal to ask. Use it as a basic market sanity check.
- `has_nonzero_bid`: True when bid is greater than zero. Use it to find contracts with actual sell-side value.
- `has_nonzero_ask`: True when ask is greater than zero. Use it to find contracts with an actionable offer.
- `has_crossed_or_locked_market`: True when bid is greater than or equal to ask. Use it to detect suspicious market states.
- `quote_age_seconds`: Age of the option quote at fetch time. Use it to avoid stale option prices. Lower is better; high values mean the option quote may be stale.
- `is_stale_quote`: Flag showing whether the option quote exceeds the staleness threshold. Use it to filter delayed quotes.
- `is_wide_market`: True when spread percentage exceeds the configured limit. Use it to remove illiquid contracts. `True` is usually a bad sign for execution quality.
- `days_bucket`: Expiration bucket from `Week_1` through `Week_4`. Use it for quick grouping of near-term maturities.
- `near_expiry_near_money_flag`: True when expiration is within 14 days and strike is within 3% of spot. Use it to highlight short-dated near-the-money contracts.
- `passes_primary_screen`: True when bid, spread, open interest, and volume all pass configured thresholds. Use it as the main tradability filter. `True` is generally better for practical trading candidates.
- `quote_quality_score`: Simple composite score built from quote validity, IV, Greeks, market structure, and freshness checks. Use it to rank rows by data quality. Higher is better.

### Run Metadata Fields

- `data_source`: Source name for the active provider. Use it for lineage and auditability.
- `risk_free_rate_used`: Risk-free rate used in Greek calculations. Use it to reproduce the Black-Scholes outputs.

Execution details that are not row-specific are written to the append-only run log `logs/opx_runs.log`, including:

- run start time
- script version
- per-ticker success or error status
- fetch timestamps
- final output file path

## Configuration

Runtime configuration lives in `~/.config/opx/config.toml`. If the file is absent, the app falls back to built-in defaults and uses `yfinance` as the active provider.
If individual config values are missing, malformed, or out of range, the loader applies built-in defaults for those fields and the fetcher prints the resolved values plus any fallback warnings at startup.

Example config:

```toml
[settings]
tickers = ["TSLA", "NVDA", "UBER", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "ORCL", "PLTR"]
data_provider = "yfinance"
min_bid = 0.50
min_open_interest = 100
min_volume = 10
max_spread_pct_of_mid = 0.25
max_strike_distance_pct = 0.30
risk_free_rate = 0.045
hv_lookback_days = 30
trading_days_per_year = 252
stale_quote_seconds = 900
enable_post_download_filters = true
max_expiration_weeks = 26

[providers.massive]
api_key = "replace-me"
snapshot_page_limit = 250
request_interval_seconds = 12.0
```

Current defaults:

- `TICKERS = ["TSLA", "NVDA", "UBER", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "ORCL", "PLTR"]`: list of underlyings to fetch.
- `MIN_BID = 0.50`: excludes very low-premium contracts, in addition to the hard `bid == 0` filter.
- `MIN_OPEN_INTEREST = 100`: baseline open-interest threshold used by the screening metrics.
- `MIN_VOLUME = 10`: baseline daily volume threshold used by the screening metrics.
- `MAX_SPREAD_PCT_OF_MID = 0.25`: excludes contracts with spreads wider than 25% of midpoint.
- `MAX_STRIKE_DISTANCE_PCT = 0.30`: keeps only strikes within +/-30% of the latest underlying price.
- `RISK_FREE_RATE = 0.045`: risk-free rate used in Black-Scholes calculations.
- `HV_LOOKBACK_DAYS = 30`: lookback window for historical volatility.
- `TRADING_DAYS_PER_YEAR = 252`: annualization factor for volatility.
- `STALE_QUOTE_SECONDS = 900`: staleness threshold for option and underlying quotes.
- `ENABLE_POST_DOWNLOAD_FILTERS = true`: applies the zero-bid, strike-band, and wide-spread row filters after download. Set it to `false` when you want the raw downloaded rows to remain in the exported dataset while still computing metrics and quality flags.
- `MAX_EXPIRATION_WEEKS = 26`: caps expirations to roughly the next six months by default. Set it to any positive week count you want, or `0` to disable the expiration cap entirely.
- `data_provider = "yfinance"`: provider implementation used by the fetch pipeline.
- `providers.massive.snapshot_page_limit = 250`: per-request Massive snapshot page size used for the option-chain endpoint. Values above `250` are clamped because the Massive snapshot endpoint rejects larger limits.
- `providers.massive.request_interval_seconds = 12.0`: minimum delay between Massive HTTP requests. This default is conservative for delayed-plan usage.
- `SCRIPT_VERSION = "2026-03-23.2"`: run-version string written to the append-only log.

In practice:

- Change `tickers` when you want a different watchlist.
- Tighten or loosen the threshold values when you want a narrower or broader tradability filter.
- Set `enable_post_download_filters = false` when you want to keep rows that would normally be removed by the shared post-download filters.
- Change `max_expiration_weeks` when you want a shorter or longer expiration window, or set it to `0` to disable the max-expiration cutoff.
- Change the rate, lookback, trading-day, or staleness settings only if you want different modeling or freshness assumptions.
- Switch `data_provider` when you want to use a different market-data implementation.
- Add `[providers.massive].api_key` only when you select `massive`.
- Raise or lower `snapshot_page_limit` and `request_interval_seconds` to match your Massive plan and tolerance for throttling.

Startup output:

- The fetcher prints the config path it read, whether the file exists, and the full set of resolved runtime values it will apply.
- Secret values are redacted in that output. For example, the Massive API key is shown as `set` or `not set`, never in plaintext.
- When a config value is invalid and a code default is used instead, the fetcher prints a `Config fallbacks:` block so the override is visible.
- During each ticker fetch, the fetcher prints provider progress, expiration counts, raw provider row counts, normalized-versus-kept row counts, and final kept rows so empty runs can be traced to a specific stage.
- `python fetcher.py` exits with status `0` after a successful CSV write and `1` when the run finishes with `No data fetched.`

## Development Setup

Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install
```

This installs both market-data client libraries used by the project, including the official `massive` client for Massive / Polygon access.

`playwright` is optional for the fetch/export pipeline itself, but required if you want automated browser screenshots or browser-driven UI checks.

For Massive / Polygon access, this project assumes you have an options-capable Massive account. The default `request_interval_seconds = 12.0` is intentionally conservative for delayed-plan usage, and you should adjust it in `~/.config/opx/config.toml` to match the actual rate limits and throughput your Massive options plan allows.

## Documentation Assets

Regenerate the viewer screenshot used in this README with:

```bash
python scripts/capture_viewer_screenshot.py
```

By default this saves a dark-mode full-page screenshot to:

```text
docs/images/viewer-option-chain.png
```

Optional flags:

```bash
python scripts/capture_viewer_screenshot.py --theme light
python scripts/capture_viewer_screenshot.py --output docs/images/viewer-custom.png
```

## Verification

Run the basic test suite with:

```bash
pytest
```

Run the linter with:

```bash
pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

## Notes

- Market data is routed through a configurable provider layer.
- Data is currently sourced from Yahoo Finance through the `yfinance` provider implementation.
- Quote timing and completeness depend on the upstream source.
- The exported CSV is intended to be consumed by another tool, so the script favors schema clarity and enriched raw data over trade recommendations.
- The viewer is intended for inspection and triage, not as a live trading terminal.
