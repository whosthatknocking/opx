# Options Fetcher

High-level Python project for collecting option chain data from Yahoo Finance, enriching it with derived metrics, and exporting the result to a timestamped CSV for downstream tools.

## What It Does

The script fetches near-term option chains for a configured list of tickers, normalizes the raw vendor data, excludes contracts with a zero bid, excludes contracts whose bid-ask spread is 25% or more of midpoint, limits contracts to strikes within +/-30% of the latest underlying price, calculates quality and pricing metrics, computes Black-Scholes Greeks, and writes a CSV file that another tool can consume.

The output is designed to be data-focused rather than decision-focused. It does not decide whether to close, roll, or open positions. Instead, it produces a richer dataset that can support those decisions elsewhere.

Warning: Yahoo Finance quote timestamps can lag, and the collected option, underlying, or VIX data may be stale. Always check the freshness fields in the CSV or browser before relying on the output for trading decisions.

## Features

- Fetches call and put chains for configured tickers
- Limits expirations to a rolling three-month window
- Excludes contracts with a zero bid
- Excludes contracts with `bid_ask_spread_pct_of_mid >= 0.25`
- Limits strikes to a +/-30% band around the latest underlying price
- Normalizes vendor fields into a stable CSV schema
- Adds quote quality, freshness, liquidity, and pricing metrics
- Adds underlying volatility context with `VIX` and trailing historical volatility
- Adds expiration-level expected move estimates
- Adds roll-yield metrics across expirations at the same strike
- Adds return-on-margin metrics using a transparent margin proxy
- Computes Black-Scholes `delta`, true ITM probability, `gamma`, `vega`, and `theta`
- Exports a timestamped CSV file for each run

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Internet access for Yahoo Finance data

Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How To Run

Run the project from the repository root:

```bash
python3 options_fetcher.py
```

## CSV Browser

Run the local viewer from the repository root:

```bash
python3 options_viewer.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

The viewer includes:

- a sortable table for the exported CSV
- hover descriptions on column headers pulled from this README
- a file selector for available CSV exports
- a `README` tab that shows the project documentation
- a dark/light mode toggle

## Output

Each run writes a CSV file in the project root using a timestamped filename:

```text
options_engine_output_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
```

## CSV Field Reference

The exported CSV contains both raw option data and derived fields. Some values may be blank when Yahoo Finance does not provide enough data or when a calculation is not valid for that row.

### Contract and Expiration Fields

- `spread_to_bid_pct`: Spread divided by bid. Use it to see how expensive the spread is relative to collectible premium.
- `oi_to_volume_ratio`: Open interest divided by volume. Use it to distinguish established positions from fresh trading activity.

### Moneyness and Value Fields

- `strike_minus_spot`: Strike minus underlying price. Use it to see whether the strike sits above or below spot.
- `strike_vs_spot_pct`: `strike_minus_spot` as a percentage of spot. Use it for normalized moneyness comparisons.
- `strike_distance_pct`: Absolute distance between strike and spot as a percentage. Use it to find near-the-money contracts.

- `expected_move_lower_bound`: Spot minus `expected_move`. Use it as the lower expected-move boundary into expiration.
- `expected_move_upper_bound`: Spot plus `expected_move`. Use it as the upper expected-move boundary into expiration.

### Greek Fields

- `delta_abs`: Absolute value of delta. Use it when you only care about magnitude, not call-versus-put sign.
- `delta_itm_proxy`: Delta normalized so higher values mean more in-the-money for both calls and puts. Use it for side-agnostic moneyness ranking.
- `probability_itm`: Black-Scholes probability of finishing in the money, derived from `d2` rather than delta. Use it when you want the model-based ITM probability instead of the delta approximation.
- `gamma`: Black-Scholes gamma. Use it to measure how quickly delta changes as the stock moves.

- `is_stale_quote`: Flag showing whether the option quote exceeds the staleness threshold. Use it to filter delayed quotes.
- `is_wide_market`: True when spread percentage exceeds the configured limit. Use it to remove illiquid contracts.
- `days_bucket`: Expiration bucket from `Week_1` through `Week_4`. Use it for quick grouping of near-term maturities.

- `risk_free_rate_used`: Risk-free rate used in Greek calculations. Use it to reproduce the Black-Scholes outputs.

Execution details that are not row-specific are written to the append-only run log `logs/options_fetcher_runs.log`, including:

- script version
- per-ticker success or error status
- fetch timestamps
- final output file path

## Configuration

Core configuration lives in `options_fetcher_app/config.py`, including:

- ticker list
- minimum liquidity thresholds
- spread threshold
- risk-free rate used for Greeks
- historical-volatility lookback
- stale quote threshold

## Notes

- Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance through `yfinance`.
- Quote timing and completeness depend on the upstream source.
- The exported CSV is intended to be consumed by another tool, so the script favors schema clarity and enriched raw data over trade recommendations.
