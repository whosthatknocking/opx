# opx

`opx` downloads near-term option chains, enriches them with pricing and screening metrics, writes a timestamped CSV, and serves the local Options Screener UI for inspection.

Its objective is to produce a cleaner, more executable options dataset that can be reviewed directly or fed into downstream tools that make decisions from the data, such as a trading system, portfolio workflow, or other automation layer. `opx` is the data and screening layer, not the decision engine itself.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install
python fetcher.py
python viewer.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

## What You Get

- Fetches call and put chains for configured tickers
- Filters out zero-bid and wide-spread contracts before export
- Limits strikes to a configurable band around spot
- Computes Greeks, expected move, ROM-style metrics, configurable option scoring, and volatility context
- Writes a timestamped CSV plus an append-only run log
- Includes a local browser for exploring the output interactively, including dataset inspection, per-ticker overview cards, `Most Profitable`, `Moderate Risk`, `High Conviction Call`, and `High Conviction Put` highlights, plus chain visualizations with chart tooltips and click-through row details
- Produces normalized output that can feed other tools and systems which apply their own decision logic on top of the exported data

Generated files are standardized under:

- `output/` for exported CSV snapshots
- `logs/` for run logs
- `debug/` for optional raw provider payload dumps

## Important Notes

- Yahoo Finance can be delayed, stale, or sparse, especially near the regular market open. Always check freshness fields before relying on the output.
- Massive support depends on your plan. Lower tiers can leave you with trades but no `bid` or `ask`, and quote access may require Massive's highest-cost quote-enabled options plan.
- Market Data plan access affects recency. The Free Forever tier is 24 hours delayed for both stock and options data, so treat that provider as end-of-day-plus data unless your plan includes fresher access.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Python dependencies installed from `requirements.txt`
- Internet access for provider data

Key dependencies:

- `yfinance` for the baseline Yahoo Finance provider
- `massive` for the official Massive / Polygon client library
- `marketdata-sdk-py` for the official Market Data client library
- `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scipy` for normalization and analytics
- `pytest` for the automated test suite
- `playwright` for browser-driven screenshot and UI checks
